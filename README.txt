What is MimikBot?

MimikBot is a simple bot that attempts to create sentences that are based on previous messages in a text channel. Usually, MimikBot produces
barely comprehensible gibberish, but every once in a while, it may just produce pure gold.

How to use MimikBot:

To add MimikBot to a server, make sure that you are the owner of the server or have permission from the owner of the server to add a bot.
Then, go to (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=780969806773878805&permissions=8&scope=bot), login if prompted, and then select 
the server you want to add MimikBot to. Note that MimikBot will have Administrator privileges.

Once MimikBot is added, you can call on MimikBot using the commands below. MimikBot always sends its message(s) to the channel which called it.

---------
$say [message]: MimikBot will say [message].

$gen: MimikBot will generate one message based on the previous 50 messages in the channel.

$gen n: MimikBot will generate n messages based on the previous 50 messages in the channel.

$changeCommandMarker [new command marker]: MimikBot will only respond to messages starting with [new command marker] instead of the current 
command marker (default: $).

$mimikbothelp: Outputs the help message. Note that the $ command marker for this command does NOT change when changeCommandMarker is called.

Thank you for enjoying MimikBot!
