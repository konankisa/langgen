But Nelson is nub and keeps thwarting my use of them
I used funds for them
my life is a comedy
Didn’t know Vishal is a man of humor
dimensional analysis
yeah I know analysis
I don’t want them I need them
Where do you get those emojis

I don't feel too confident after physics and math midterms about my GPA for those classes
I hope GPA doesn't impact me too much
I don't want to take mechanics for the fourth time
I agree with that Morgan it’s just my plan after graduation requires wickedly high GPA
I'll probably take honors chem
I hadn't even thought that far ahead
more like I get to take less computer science if I take more math but sure
A true scholar
I don't know I'm willing to get a lower grade for more information
Yeah but grade wise some of us would probably do better in Intro Calc
i would say intro calc sucks probably but honors calc doesn't
honor is different
well
I am taking honor physics and I think it’s fantastic
i definitely haven't been thinking about taking intro physics and intro chem for grad requirements
intro physics also sucks
Intro computer science classes are very cringe
But this is common to most intro classes
I have to take it anyways
oops
Do take the intro chem sequence in case you get professor varani
I am already in MATH 134 cuz I like pain bruh
Do yourself a favor just don’t.
My very sincere suggestion guys, unless you like pain and busy work or are somehow required, please don't take intro gen chem sequence.
Writing in proofs has tainted me; I now want to write my essays like proofs as well.
It’s for what color of power you should use when summoning the God of that subject during the exam to help you out.
Are these like colors for something or just like associations
I want medicine to be white although that’s so uncreative
Hmm I think math/philosophy blue, literature red, science green, humanities orange, languages yellow, medicine sea-foam green (like scrubs), computer science blac
k, culinary white, theater purple.
Math is the color of space. Either that or just paper white.
Definitely not influenced by anything.
I imagine math as blue on a black background.
ew lenses
Physics is the color of golden yellow light coming through a convex lens.
but not yellow
maybe red
But physics is definitely blue.
In fact I might agree with it.
Or more precisely, the color of aqueous copper(II) sulfate.
